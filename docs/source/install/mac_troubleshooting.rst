**Installing the prebuilt app package:**

*   With some version of the RAW installer, you may get a warning message the
    first time you run the program. If that happens, right click on RAW and select :menuselection:`Open`
    from the right click menu, and then click the :guilabel:`Open` button in the window that appears.

    *   This requires administrator privileges

*   If the above doesnâ€™t work, you can run the RAW app from the command line. Navigate to
    :file:`RAW.app/Contents/MacOS` and run the RAW executable file (:file:`./RAW`) in that directory.


**Installing from source:**

*   If you fail to build the extensions before running RAW, RAW will crash at some point.
    Be sure to run the ``python setup.py build_ext --inplace`` before starting RAW.

*   Using the RAW autorg function requires a relatively recent version of numba.
    If you get an error running this function update your numba version to the
    most recent.

*   If you are installing on an older Macbook (older than ~2012) you need to install all packages
    through conda forge (``conda install -c conda-forge <package_name>``). The
    new ones in the main conda channel cuase an illegal instruction error.
    See this thread: `https://github.com/conda/conda/issues/9678 <https://github.com/conda/conda/issues/9678>`_.
    It's possible this will be resolved at some point and the main channel
    will be usable for older machines again.
