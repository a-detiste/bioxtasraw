RAW Install Guide for Linux
---------------------------

There are two ways to install RAW on Linux. The easiest, and recommended, way is to use a
prebuilt debian/ubuntu package (:file:`.deb` file). This will work on Debian 10 and newer,
Ubuntu 18.04 LTS and newer, and any similar Ubuntu/Debian-based OSes like Linux Mint.

If you are on a different OS, such as CentOS, or you want to install a version for which there
is no prebuilt installer, you will need to install RAW from the source code.
